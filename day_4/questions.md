## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
   The purpose of a method is to be able to write a block of code that can be used over and over just by calling a simple statement.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
   def hello()
     print "Sam I am"
   end    

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
   def hello_someone (name)
     print "#{name} I am"
   end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
   hello_someone(Sam)

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
   Nothing at the moment!
